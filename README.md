My first project practicing with geographic data plotting. 

For this project I am using data from eBird. Currently working with a sample of the Basic Dataset available on the site. The sample dataset has observational data for Montgomery Alabama for January 2019.

I am practicing with this smaller dataset before scaling it to the larger, full dataset.
