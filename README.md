### My first project practicing with geographic data plotting. 

For this project I am using data from eBird. I'm currently working with a sample of the Basic Dataset available on the site. The sample dataset has observational data for Montgomery Alabama for January 2019.

I am practicing with this smaller dataset before scaling it to the larger, full dataset which I have downloaded to an external hard-drive. 

## How to Use
Download the CSV file and __all__ of the cb_2018_us... files to the same directory as the working notebook or .py file. All of the cb_2018 files must be downloaded in order to perform the geographic plotting as they contain information for the geographic polygon points.
